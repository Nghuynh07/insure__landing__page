## Acknowledgments

Thank you @vanzasetia from FM for his comment on my previous project regarding prefers-reduced-motion. This is important for accessibility for motion triggered vestibular spectrum disorder individual. I'll be adding this concept into all my projects from now on. I also learned NOT to set font size to 62.5%. An article above regarding not setting the html font-size to 62.5% by Josh W Comeau.
